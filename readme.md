This data analytics project aims to explore and examine a dataset fetched from Kaggle. The dataset includes a variety of information about user interaction with music tracks, including information such as the artist, track, duration, danceability, energy, tempo, loudness and stream count.

## Project Overview

The project involves two main phases: exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive analysis. In the EDA phase, we will explore the dataset to gain insights and understanding of the data. We will use various statistical techniques and visualizations to summarize the data and identify patterns. In the predictive analysis phase, we will build models to predict the popularity of music tracks based on their various attributes. This project concludes the data integrity and correlation.

## Dataset Description

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube) has 20718 rows Ã— 28 columns. Indepth description on the dataset can be found on Kaggle.

## Tools and Techniques

We will be using various data analytics tools and techniques to analyze and model the dataset, including:

* Python3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas, NumPy & PySpark for data manipulation and cleaning
* Matplotlib, plotly and Seaborn for data visualization
* Scikit-learn library for predictive modeling
* Regression analysis and machine learning algorithms such as linear regression and random forest.

## Project Deliverables

A Jupyter Notebook containing the EDA and predictive analysis code summarizing the project findings, insights, and recommendations as a HTML Document.
